This gives our deformation a \r\n        jelly-like effect. Additionally, the damage value for each vertex is tracked. The max\r\n        value is taken between the previous max value and the current damage value in order\r\n        to persist damage. The mesh is rendered using a shader that accepts two textures (base\r\n        and damage) and interpolates between them based on the damage. \r\n      </div>\r\n      <v-img :src=\"require('../../assets/seq_2.svg')\" \r\n        max-width=\"650\" style=\"margin: 10px auto\"/>\r\n      <div class=\"subtitle font-weight-bold\">Fig 4: Deformation and Damage Calculation</div>\r\n      <div class=\"title\" style=\"margin-top: 20px\">\r\n        Space and Time Complexity\r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        For both steps of the algorithm, we frame them in the context of a mesh made up of n vertices. \r\n        We loop over those vertices to update various components (position, normals) a constant number\r\n        of times per update. As a result, we can bound the time complexity by O(n). In the context of \r\n        space complexity, we rely on several different channels associated with each vertex, but the\r\n        number of channels is constant, leaving us with O(n) space complexity. \r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"headline font-weight-regular\">Results</div>\r\n      <iframe src=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kkjBWSZXx4xxitHoJz_UGvgduqveET2t/preview\" width=\"640\" height=\"480\"></iframe>\r\n\r\n      <div class=\"headline font-weight-regular\">Final Thoughts</div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        Our team was not fully satisfied with the results we achieved. We feel that while Unity made\r\n        some things simpler, the learning time was a little steep compared to the time required for \r\n        creating a custom OpenGL/C++ framework. \r\n      </div>\r\n      <div>\r\n        With a little more time and effort, we would've liked to experiment with a more interesting \r\n        example than a vague sphere with stretch marks. Additionally, we would've loved to implement\r\n        a patch-based approach that applied the damage in patches rather than continuously/smoothly.\r\n      </div>\r\n\r\n    </div>\r\n  </div>\r\n</template>\r\n\r\n<script>\r\n\r\nexport default {\r\n  data() {\r\n    return {\r\n      meta: this.$store.state.update_meta[1]\r\n    };\r\n  }\r\n};\r\n</script>\r\n\r\n<style>\r\n.headline {\r\n  border-bottom: 1px solid black;\r\n  margin: 20px auto 10px auto;\r\n}\r\n\r\n.subtitle {\r\n  text-align: center;\r\n}\r\n</style>\r\n","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./U_2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./U_2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"","import { render, staticRenderFns } from \"./U_2.vue?vue&type=template&id=1b37860b&\"\nimport script from \"./U_2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nexport * from \"./U_2.vue?vue&type=script&lang=js&\"\nimport style0 from \"./U_2.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"\n\n\n/* normalize component */\nimport normalizer from \"!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/runtime/componentNormalizer.js\"\nvar component = normalizer(\n  script,\n  render,\n  staticRenderFns,\n  false,\n  null,\n  null,\n  null\n  \n)\n\nexport default component.exports\n\n/* vuetify-loader */\nimport installComponents from \"!../../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/runtime/installComponents.js\"\nimport { VImg } from 'vuetify/lib/components/VImg';\ninstallComponents(component, {VImg})\n","module.exports = __webpack_public_path__ + \"img/styleblitlive.db1a9def.gif\";","import mod from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./U_2.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\"; export default mod; export * from \"-!../../../node_modules/mini-css-extract-plugin/dist/loader.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-0!../../../node_modules/css-loader/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-1!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/loaders/stylePostLoader.js!../../../node_modules/postcss-loader/src/index.js??ref--6-oneOf-1-2!../../../node_modules/vuetify-loader/lib/loader.js!../../../node_modules/cache-loader/dist/cjs.js??ref--0-0!../../../node_modules/vue-loader/lib/index.js??vue-loader-options!./U_2.vue?vue&type=style&index=0&lang=css&\""],"sourceRoot":""}
